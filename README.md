# Javascript-tetris
Based on the tutorial by Ania Kubow for FreeCodeCamp. This is a javascript tetris game.

I compartmentalised some of the repeated code into separate functions.
For example, I made a function that returns true if the tetromino is in an invalid position.

I also added functionality for the start/pause button to clear the board and start a new game if a game over state was reached.

I intend to add controls for touchscreen playing and keep everything in the one small screen size to prevent accidental scrolling.
